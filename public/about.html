<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Etimbuk Akaninyene Ukpong, a passionate student from Nigeria, currently studying National Diploma in Accounting (ND1). Alongside my academic journey in finance and numbers, I’ve developed a strong interest in web development.
</p>
<p>
I'm learning how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy creating clean, simple, and responsive designs. My goal is to combine my knowledge of accounting with tech skills to build tools that help businesses and individuals manage their finances more effectively.

This portfolio showcases the projects I’ve worked on as I grow my skills as a web developer. I'm excited about learning new technologies and turning ideas into real-world solutions.
